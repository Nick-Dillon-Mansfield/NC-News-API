FROM node

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./         # this would copy any package file that starts with package and ends in .json - copied into the current location

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "run", "migrate-and-start"]        # We will build the migrate-and-start script in the package.json file
                                               #"migrate-and-start": "npm run migrate-latest && npm start"
